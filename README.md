# Flutter recipe App

An app to simulate and Recipe App

I've implemented it based on a Flutter online course (Alura: https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/flutter-introducao)

- List View
- Switch between different screens
- Send information to another screen (Navigator push/pop)
- StateFulWidget / StatelessWidget

Tested in Android and iOS
